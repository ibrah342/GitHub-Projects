# DO NOT GIVE TestAllMaker.java TO STUDENTS 
### Please read the overall project README before submitting anything to students.

---
### When helping students see which test fails, have them fix the first test case that fails, as the use of Scanner messes up the boolean values and causes confusion.
### If you choose to use these tests, all other files in this directory must be added to the codepack. Also, you will have to update the grading environment to accommodat this change.
