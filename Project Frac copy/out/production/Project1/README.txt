Contributions of each partner:

Ayub Farah: Worked on the Circle class, worked on the helper functions(drawCircleFractal,drawTriangleFractal,
drawRectangleFractal) to make the recursive call, positioned all the different x and y coordinates for the fractals, and
made it so the color changes with each level.

Abdirahman Ibrahim: Worked on Rectangle and Triangle classes, worked on the drawFractal class, worked on the scanner and
the main function, and made sure the comments, and styling are easy to read for TA's to run the program.

How to compile and run your program: Put in either Circle, Triangle, Rectangle after running the program. The First
letter has to be capitalized and there can't be any spaces after.

Assumptions: I am assuming the user types in a shape, and if the fractal drawing doesn't look completed or is missing
 a part that the person running the code will full screen the tab.

Additional features: Made it so the person typing see's all the shapes available to choose from.

Any known bugs or defects in the program: None

Outside sources:
    Idea 1: Getting help on the scanners, changing the color, and the positioning for the shapes from TA's
    Idea 2: Using W3 school for syntax
